# Contribution Guidelines

- Add one link per Pull Request.
- Continue to follow the alphabetical ordering that is in place per section.
- Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add <Project Name>`, e.g. `Add Motoko Playground`
- Use a short descriptive commit message, e.g. ❌Update README.md ✔Add Motoko Playground
- Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Don't mention "Awesome" in the repository name while adding a link in the README if you are adding an awesome repository, e.g. ❌Awesome-Motoko  ✔Motoko

> Thanks! We look forward to reviewing a great PR from you.
